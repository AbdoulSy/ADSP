# ADSP: Application Development Surveillance Platform.

### The Idea:
 Technologies that can make machines understand the data and it's meaning have emerged
 and the complexity of developping these higly abstract concepts can be daunting, especially when working on
 everything at the same time.
 Let's leverage this new suite of technologies to help teams create project from the Abstract way downwards to help
 teams focus on the business logic, without having to worry about details that can slip up.

### How:
 Using a little bit of Web Semantics (and later on AI) technologies.
 Such as RDF Reasoning in turtle and Marklogic as a triple store, a web assets analyser in node and Perl, 
 and a Modified Trello clone in Phoenix as a Front End, the App should be Able to suggest at any time, what to do next,
 Who should do it if available, and resolves itself when the code is conform to the task's rules.
